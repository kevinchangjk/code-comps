# Codeforces

It started in 2019 when I was just learning to code, with Python as my first programming language. Since then, I have been going onto Codeforces every now and then, checking out new problems, taking part in contests occasionally.

### Solutions

These are the programs I have written for various problems. Most were in Codeforces contests, some do not actually solve the problem, but all of them were written with a lot of pain and effort.

I also have some code for Google's Code Jam 2021 and 2022.
