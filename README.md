# Codeforces

### by [kevinchangjk](https://github.com/kevinchangjk)

It started in 2019 when I was just learning to code, with Python as my first programming language. Since then, I have been going onto Codeforces every now and then, checking out new problems, taking part in contests occasionally.

### Solutions

These are the programs I have written for Codeforces problems. Most were in contests, some do not actually solve the problem, but all of them were written with a lot of pain and effort.
